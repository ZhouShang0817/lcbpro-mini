instruction: "LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.\n\nThe agent must create\
  \ a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.\nThis task does not include local test\
  \ cases. Instead, the test harness:\n  1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit)\
  \ to get a sid,\n  2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == \"done\",\n\
  \  3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.\n\nEnvironment variables\
  \ (overridable at runtime):\n  - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)\n\
  \  - PID: problem id (default 1999D)\n  - LANG: language (default cpp)\n  - CODE_PATH:\
  \ path to code (default /app/main.cpp)\n  - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds\
  \ (default 120)\n\nSlavic has a very tough exam and needs your help in order to\
  \ pass it. Here is the question he is struggling with:\n\nThere exists a string\
  \ $s$, which consists of lowercase English letters and possibly zero or more \"\
  ?\".\n\nSlavic is asked to change each \"?\" to a lowercase English letter such\
  \ that string $t$ becomes a subsequence (not necessarily continuous) of the string\
  \ $s$.\n\nOutput any such string, or say that it is impossible in case no string\
  \ that respects the conditions exists.\n\n### Input\n\nThe first line contains a\
  \ single integer $T$ ($1 \\leq T \\leq 10^4$) -- the number of test cases.\n\nThe\
  \ first line of each test case contains a single string $s$ ($1 \\leq |s| \\leq\
  \ 2 \\cdot 10^5$, and $s$ consists only of lowercase English letters and \"?\"-s)\
  \  -- the original string you have.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains\
  \ a single string $t$ ($1 \\leq |t| \\leq |s|$, and $t$ consists only of lowercase\
  \ English letters)  -- the string that should be a subsequence of string $s$.\n\n\
  The sum of $|s|$ over all test cases doesn't exceed $2 \\cdot 10^5$, where $|x|$\
  \ denotes the length of the string $x$.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, if\
  \ no such string exists as described in the statement, output \"NO\" (without quotes).\n\
  \nOtherwise, output \"YES\" (without quotes). Then, output one line -- the string\
  \ that respects all conditions.\n\nYou can output \"YES\" and \"NO\" in any case\
  \ (for example, strings \"yEs\", \"yes\", and \"Yes\" will be recognized as a positive\
  \ response).\n\nIf multiple answers are possible, you can output any of them.\n\n\
  ### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n5\n\n?????\n\nxbx\n\nab??e\n\nabcde\n\nayy?x\n\
  \na\n\nab??e\n\ndac\n\npaiu\n\nmom\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\nYES\nxabax\n\
  YES\nabcde\nYES\nayyyx\nNO\nNO\n```"
