      LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.

      The agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.
      This task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:
        1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,
        2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == "done",
        3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.

      Environment variables (overridable at runtime):
        - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)
        - PID: problem id (default 2121E)
        - LANG: language (default cpp)
        - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)
        - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)

      Problem - Minimize matches with endpoints.

      Given two non-negative integers l and r that share the same decimal length,
      choose an integer x in [l, r] to minimize:
        f(l, x) + f(x, r),
      where f(a, b) is the number of positions i whose decimal digits are equal
      when a and b are compared as fixed-length strings.

      Input
        t - number of test cases.
        For each test case: l r (same length in decimal).

      Output
        For each test case, print the minimal possible value of f(l, x) + f(x, r).
