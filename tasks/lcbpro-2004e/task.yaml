instruction: "LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.\n\nThe agent must create\
  \ a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.\nThis task does not include local test\
  \ cases. Instead, the test harness:\n  1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit)\
  \ to get a sid,\n  2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == \"done\",\n\
  \  3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.\n\nEnvironment variables\
  \ (overridable at runtime):\n  - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)\n\
  \  - PID: problem id (default 2004E)\n  - LANG: language (default cpp)\n  - CODE_PATH:\
  \ path to code (default /app/main.cpp)\n  - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds\
  \ (default 120)\n\nTwo players, Alice and Bob, are playing a game. They have $n$\
  \ piles of stones, with the $i$-th pile initially containing $a_i$ stones.\n\nOn\
  \ their turn, a player can choose any pile of stones and take any positive number\
  \ of stones from it, with one condition:\n\n- let the current number of stones in\
  \ the pile be $x$. It is not allowed to take from the pile a number of stones $y$\
  \ such that the greatest common divisor of $x$ and $y$ is not equal to $1$.\n\n\
  The player who cannot make a move loses. Both players play optimally (that is, if\
  \ a player has a strategy that allows them to win, no matter how the opponent responds,\
  \ they will win). Alice goes first.\n\nDetermine who will win.\n\n### Input\n\n\
  The first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 10^4$) -- the number\
  \ of test cases.\n\nEach test case consists of two lines:\n\n- the first line contains\
  \ a single integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 3 \\cdot 10^5$);\n- the second line contains\
  \ $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$ ($1 \\le a_i \\le 10^7$).\n\nAdditional constraint\
  \ on the input: the sum of $n$ across all test cases does not exceed $3 \\cdot 10^5$.\n\
  \n### Output\n\nFor each test case, output Alice if Alice wins, or Bob if Bob wins.\n\
  \n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n3\n\n3\n\n3 2 9\n\n4\n\n3 3 6 1\n\n5\n\n\
  1 2 3 4 5\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\nBob\nAlice\nBob\n```"
