instruction: "LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.\n\nThe agent must create\
  \ a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.\nThis task does not include local test\
  \ cases. Instead, the test harness:\n  1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit)\
  \ to get a sid,\n  2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == \"done\",\n\
  \  3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.\n\nEnvironment variables\
  \ (overridable at runtime):\n  - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)\n\
  \  - PID: problem id (default 2086F)\n  - LANG: language (default cpp)\n  - CODE_PATH:\
  \ path to code (default /app/main.cpp)\n  - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds\
  \ (default 120)\n\nThis is an interactive problem.\n\nThe jury has a string $s$\
  \ consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The following constraints apply to this\
  \ string:\n\n- the string has an odd length that does not exceed $99$;\n- the string\
  \ consists only of the characters \"a\" and \"b\".\n\nThere is also a string $t$,\
  \ which is initially empty. Then, $|s|$ steps happen. During the $i$-th step, the\
  \ following events occur:\n\n- first, the jury tells you the character $s_i$ and\
  \ appends it to the end of the string $t$;\n- then, you may swap any two characters\
  \ in $t$, or do nothing.\n\nYour task is to ensure that after the $|s|$-th step,\
  \ the string $t$ is a palindrome.\n\n### Interaction\n\nThe interactive interaction\
  \ starts immediately.\n\nDuring each step, your program will receive one character --\
  \ the next character of the string $s$ or \"0\" (zero) if the string has ended.\
  \ If the character \"0\" is received, your program must terminate immediately.\n\
  \nAfter receiving $s_{i}$, you must output the positions of the characters to be\
  \ swapped, that is, two integers $l$ and $r$ ($1 \\le l,r \\le i$) or, if you do\
  \ not want to swap characters, then \"0 0\".\n\nIf your program makes an invalid\
  \ operation, for example, by trying to swap characters from non-existing positions,\
  \ or the resulting string $t$ is not a palindrome, the jury program will print one\
  \ character \"X\" on a separate line. If your program receives \"X\" as the response,\
  \ it should terminate immediately; otherwise, the verdict of your submission will\
  \ be undefined.\n\nThe interactor in this problem is not adaptive, meaning that\
  \ the string $s$ does not change during the interaction.\n\nAfter each output request,\
  \ do not forget to output a newline and flush the output buffer. Otherwise, you\
  \ will receive a verdict of \"Idleness limit exceeded\". To do this, use:\n\n- fflush(stdout)\
  \ or cout.flush() in C++;\n- System.out.flush() in Java;\n- sys.stdout.flush() in\
  \ Python;\n- refer to the documentation for other languages.\n\nHack format\n\n\
  For hacks, use the following format.\n\nThe first line should contain a single integer\
  \ $|s|$ -- the length of the string $s$.\n\nThe second line should contain the $s$\
  \ itself ($1 \\le |s| \\le 99, |s| \\bmod 2 = 1$), consisting of lowercase Latin\
  \ letters \"a\" and \"b\".\n\n### Examples\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\na\n\na\n\nb\n\
