  \ Islands\n\nTwo of Farmer John's cows, Bessie and Elsie, are planning to race on\
  \ $n$ islands. There are $n - 1$ main bridges, connecting island $i$ to island $i\
  \ + 1$ for all $1 \\leq i \\leq n - 1$. Additionally, there are $m$ alternative\
  \ bridges. Elsie can use both main and alternative bridges, while Bessie can only\
  \ use main bridges. All bridges are one way and can only be used to travel from\
  \ an island with a lower index to an island with a higher index.\n\nInitially, Elsie\
  \ starts on island $1$, and Bessie starts on island $s$. The cows alternate turns,\
  \ with Bessie making the first turn. Suppose the cow is on island $i$. During a\
  \ cow's turn, if there are any bridges connecting island $i$ to island $j$, then\
  \ the cow can move to island $j$. Then, island $i$ collapses, and all bridges connecting\
  \ to island $i$ also collapse. Also, note the following:\n\n- If there are no bridges\
  \ connecting island $i$ to another island, then island $i$ collapses, and this cow\
  \ is eliminated from the race.\n- If the other cow is also on island $i$, then after\
  \ this cow moves to another island, the island collapses, and the other cow is eliminated\
  \ from the race.\n- After an island or bridge collapses, no cows may use them.\n\
  - If a cow is eliminated, their turn is skipped for the rest of the race.\n\nThe\
  \ race ends once either cow reaches island $n$. It can be shown that regardless\
  \ of the cows' strategies, at least one cow reaches island $n$. Bessie wins if and\
  \ only if she reaches island $n$ first.\n\nFor each $1 \\leq s \\leq n - 1$, determine\
  \ whether Bessie wins if she starts the race on island $s$. Assume both cows follow\
  \ optimal strategies to ensure their own respective victories.\n\n### Input\n\n\
  The first line contains $t$ ($1 \\leq t \\leq 10^4$) -- the number of test cases.\n\
  \nThe first line of each test case contains $n$ and $m$ ($2 \\leq n \\leq 2 \\cdot\
  \ 10^5$, $0 \\leq m \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5$) -- the number of islands and the number\
  \ of alternative bridges.\n\nThe next $m$ lines of each test case contain $u$ and\
  \ $v$ ($1 \\leq u < v \\leq n$) -- the islands that the alternative bridge connects.\
  \ It is guaranteed all alternative bridges are distinct, and they do not coincide\
  \ with the main bridges.\n\nIt is guaranteed that neither the sum of $n$ nor the\
  \ sum of $m$ over all test cases exceeds $2 \\cdot 10^5$.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each\
  \ test case, output a binary string of length $n - 1$ on a new line. The $i$'th\
  \ character is $1$ if it is possible for Bessie to win if she starts on island $i$.\
  \ Otherwise, it is $0$.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n5\n\n6 0\n\n6\
  \ 1\n\n2 6\n\n6 1\n\n1 5\n\n10 4\n\n1 3\n\n1 6\n\n2 7\n\n3 8\n\n15 3\n\n2 8\n\n\
  4 9\n\n8 15\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n11111\n11011\n10011\n100001111\n11000111000111\n\
  ```\n\n### Note\n\nIn the first test case, there are no alternative bridges for\
  \ Elsie to overtake Bessie and reach island $n$ first, so Bessie will win on all\
  \ islands because she always moves first.\n\nIn the second case, Bessie will lose\
  \ if she starts on island $3$ because:\n\n- Bessie's Turn: Take a main bridge from\
  \ island $3$ to island $4$.\n- Elsie's Turn: Take a main bridge from island $1$\
  \ to island $2$.\n- Bessie's Turn: Take a main bridge from island $4$ to island\
  \ $5$.\n- Elsie's Turn: Take an alternative bridge from island $2$ to island $6$.\
  \ Elsie reaches island $n$ first."
