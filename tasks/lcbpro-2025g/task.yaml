instruction: "LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.\n\nThe agent must create\
  \ a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.\nThis task does not include local test\
  \ cases. Instead, the test harness:\n  1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit)\
  \ to get a sid,\n  2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == \"done\",\n\
  \  3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.\n\nEnvironment variables\
  \ (overridable at runtime):\n  - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)\n\

  \ (default 120)\n\nMonocarp is gathering an army to fight a dragon in a videogame.\n\
  \nThe army consists of two parts: the heroes and the defensive artifacts. Each hero\
  \ has one parameter -- his health. Each defensive artifact also has one parameter --\
  \ its durability.\n\nBefore the battle begins, Monocarp distributes artifacts to\
  \ the heroes so that each hero receives at most one artifact.\n\nThe battle consists\
  \ of rounds that proceed as follows:\n\n- first, the dragon deals damage equal to\
  \ $\\frac{1}{a + b}$ (a real number without rounding) to each hero, where $a$ is\
  \ the number of heroes alive and $b$ is the number of active artifacts;\n- after\
  \ that, all heroes with health $0$ or less die;\n- finally, some artifacts are deactivated.\
  \ An artifact with durability $x$ is deactivated when one of the following occurs:\
  \ the hero holding the artifact either dies or receives $x$ total damage (from the\
  \ start of the battle). If an artifact is not held by any hero, it is inactive from\
  \ the beginning of the battle.\n\nThe battle ends when there are no heroes left\
  \ alive.\n\nInitially, the army is empty. There are $q$ queries: add a hero with\
  \ health $x$ or an artifact with durability $y$ to the army. After each query, determine\
  \ the maximum number of rounds that Monocarp can survive if he distributes the artifacts\
  \ optimally.\n\n### Input\n\nThe first line contains one integer $q$ ($1 \\le q\
  \ \\le 3 \\cdot 10^5$) -- the number of queries.\n\nIn the $i$-th of the following\
  \ $q$ lines, there are two integers $t_i$ and $v_i$ ($t_i \\in \\{1, 2\\}$; $1 \\\
  le v_i \\le 10^9$) -- the type of the query and the value of the query parameter.\
  \ If the type is $1$, a hero with health $v_i$ is added. If the type is $2$, an\
  \ artifact with durability $v_i$ is added.\n\n### Output\n\nPrint $q$ integers.\
  \ After each query, output the maximum number of rounds that Monocarp can survive\
  \ if he distributes the artifacts optimally.\n\n### Examples\n\n#### Input #1\n\n\
  ```\n\n3\n\n2 5\n\n1 4\n\n1 10\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n0\n8\n19\n```\n\n\
  #### Input #2\n\n```\n\n10\n\n1 9\n\n1 6\n\n2 4\n\n1 8\n\n1 3\n\n2 10\n\n1 3\n\n\
  1 6\n\n1 10\n\n2 6\n\n```\n\n#### Output #2\n\n```\n9\n15\n19\n27\n30\n39\n42\n\
  48\n59\n65\n```\n\n### Note\n\nLet's consider the first example.\n\n- An artifact\
  \ with durability $5$ is added. Since there are no heroes yet, the battle ends immediately.\n\
  - A hero with health $4$ is added. Monocarp can give him an artifact with durability\
  \ $5$. First, there are rounds in which the hero takes $\\frac{1}{1 + 1} = \\frac{1}{2}$\
  \ damage. After $8$ such rounds, a total of $4$ damage will have been dealt, and\
  \ the hero will die, while the artifact will deactivate. There are no more heroes\
  \ alive, so the battle ends after $8$ rounds.\n- A hero with health $10$ is added.\
  \ Now let the artifact with durability $5$ be with this hero. Then, in the first\
  \ $12$ rounds, the heroes will take $12 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2 + 1} = 4$ damage, and\
  \ the first hero will die. The second hero has $6$ health left, and the artifact\
  \ has $1$ durability. Now the damage is $\\frac{1}{2}$, so after another $2$ rounds,\
  \ the artifact will deactivate. The second hero has $5$ health left. After another\
  \ $5$ rounds, the second hero will die. Therefore, the answer is $12 + 2 + 5 = 19$."
