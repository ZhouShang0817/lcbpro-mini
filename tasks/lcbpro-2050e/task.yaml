instruction: "LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.\n\nThe agent must create\
  \ a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.\nThis task does not include local test\
  \ cases. Instead, the test harness:\n  1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit)\
  \ to get a sid,\n  2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == \"done\",\n\
  \  3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.\n\nEnvironment variables\
  \ (overridable at runtime):\n  - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)\n\
  \  - PID: problem id (default 2050E)\n  - LANG: language (default cpp)\n  - CODE_PATH:\
  \ path to code (default /app/main.cpp)\n  - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds\
  \ (default 120)\n\nYou are given three strings: $a$, $b$, and $c$, consisting of\
  \ lowercase Latin letters. The string $c$ was obtained in the following way:\n\n\
  1. At each step, either string $a$ or string $b$ was randomly chosen, and the first\
  \ character of the chosen string was removed from it and appended to the end of\
  \ string $c$, until one of the strings ran out. After that, the remaining characters\
  \ of the non-empty string were added to the end of $c$.\n2. Then, a certain number\
  \ of characters in string $c$ were randomly changed.\n\nFor example, from the strings\
  \ $a=\\color{red}{\\text{abra}}$ and $b=\\color{blue}{\\text{cada}}$, without character\
  \ replacements, the strings $\\color{blue}{\\text{ca}}\\color{red}{\\text{ab}}\\\
  color{blue}{\\text{d}}\\color{red}{\\text{ra}}\\color{blue}{\\text{a}}$, $\\color{red}{\\\
  text{abra}}\\color{blue}{\\text{cada}}$, $\\color{red}{\\text{a}}\\color{blue}{\\\
  text{cada}}\\color{red}{\\text{bra}}$ could be obtained.\n\nFind the minimum number\
  \ of characters that could have been changed in string $c$.\n\n### Input\n\nThe\
  \ first line of the input contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 10^3$) --\
  \ the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains one string\
  \ of lowercase Latin letters $a$ ($1 \\leq |a| \\leq 10^3$) -- the first string,\
  \ where $|a|$ denotes the length of string $a$.\n\nThe second line of each test\
  \ case contains one string of lowercase Latin letters $b$ ($1 \\leq |b| \\leq 10^3$) --\
  \ the second string, where $|b|$ denotes the length of string $b$.\n\nThe third\
  \ line of each test case contains one string of lowercase Latin letters $c$ ($|c|\
  \ = |a| + |b|$) -- the third string.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $|a|$ across\
  \ all test cases does not exceed $2 \\cdot 10^3$. Also, the sum of $|b|$ across\
  \ all test cases does not exceed $2 \\cdot 10^3$.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test\
  \ case, output a single integer -- the minimum number of characters that could have\
  \ been changed in string $c$.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n7\n\na\n\
  \nb\n\ncb\n\nab\n\ncd\n\nacbd\n\nab\n\nba\n\naabb\n\nxxx\n\nyyy\n\nxyxyxy\n\na\n\
  \nbcd\n\ndecf\n\ncodes\n\nhorse\n\ncodeforces\n\negg\n\nannie\n\negaegaeg\n\n```\n\
  \n#### Output #1\n\n```\n1\n0\n2\n0\n3\n2\n3\n```"
