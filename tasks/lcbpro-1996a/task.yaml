instruction: "LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.\n\nThe agent must create\
  \ a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.\nThis task does not include local test\
  \ cases. Instead, the test harness:\n  1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit)\
  \ to get a sid,\n  2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == \"done\",\n\
  \  3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.\n\nEnvironment variables\
  \ (overridable at runtime):\n  - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)\n\
  \  - PID: problem id (default 1996A)\n  - LANG: language (default cpp)\n  - CODE_PATH:\
  \ path to code (default /app/main.cpp)\n  - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds\
  \ (default 120)\n\nIt's another beautiful day on Farmer John's farm.\n\nAfter Farmer\
  \ John arrived at his farm, he counted $n$ legs. It is known only chickens and cows\
  \ live on the farm, and a chicken has $2$ legs while a cow has $4$.\n\nWhat is the\
  \ minimum number of animals Farmer John can have on his farm assuming he counted\
  \ the legs of all animals?\n\n### Input\n\nThe first line contains single integer\
  \ $t$ ($1 \\leq t \\leq 10^3$)Â -- the number of test cases.\n\nEach test case contains\
  \ an integer $n$ ($2 \\leq n \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^3$, $n$ is even).\n\n### Output\n\
  \nFor each test case, output an integer, the minimum number of animals Farmer John\
  \ can have on his farm.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n3\n\n2\n\n6\n\n\
  8\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n1\n2\n2\n```"
