instruction: "LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.\n\nThe agent must create\
  \ a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.\nThis task does not include local test\
  \ cases. Instead, the test harness:\n  1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit)\
  \ to get a sid,\n  2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == \"done\",\n\
  \  3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.\n\nEnvironment variables\
  \ (overridable at runtime):\n  - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)\n\
  \  - PID: problem id (default 2002B)\n  - LANG: language (default cpp)\n  - CODE_PATH:\
  \ path to code (default /app/main.cpp)\n  - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds\
  \ (default 120)\n\nAlice got a permutation $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$ of $[1,2,\\\
  ldots,n]$, and Bob got another permutation $b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_n$ of $[1,2,\\\
  ldots,n]$. They are going to play a game with these arrays.\n\nIn each turn, the\
  \ following events happen in order:\n\n- Alice chooses either the first or the last\
  \ element of her array and removes it from the array;\n- Bob chooses either the\
  \ first or the last element of his array and removes it from the array.\n\nThe game\
  \ continues for $n-1$ turns, after which both arrays will have exactly one remaining\
  \ element: $x$ in the array $a$ and $y$ in the array $b$.\n\nIf $x=y$, Bob wins;\
  \ otherwise, Alice wins. Find which player will win if both players play optimally.\n\
  \n### Input\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the\
  \ number of test cases $t$ ($1\\le t\\le10^4$). The description of the test cases\
  \ follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer $n$ ($1\\\
  le n\\le 3\\cdot 10^5$).\n\nThe next line contains $n$ integers $a_1,a_2,\\ldots,a_n$\
  \ ($1\\le a_i\\le n$, all $a_i$ are distinct) -- the permutation of Alice.\n\nThe\
  \ next line contains $n$ integers $b_1,b_2,\\ldots,b_n$ ($1\\le b_i\\le n$, all\
  \ $b_i$ are distinct) -- the permutation of Bob.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum\
  \ of all $n$ does not exceed $3\\cdot 10^5$.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case,\
  \ print a single line with the name of the winner, assuming both players play optimally.\
  \ If Alice wins, print $\\texttt{Alice}$; otherwise, print $\\texttt{Bob}$.\n\n\
  ### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n2\n\n2\n\n1 2\n\n1 2\n\n3\n\n1 2 3\n\n2 3\
  \ 1\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\nBob\nAlice\n```\n\n### Note\n\nIn the first\
  \ test case, Bob can win the game by deleting the same element as Alice did.\n\n\
  In the second test case, Alice can delete $3$ in the first turn, and then in the\
  \ second turn, delete the element that is different from the one Bob deleted in\
  \ the first turn to win the game."
