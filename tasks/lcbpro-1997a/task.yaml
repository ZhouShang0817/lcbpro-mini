instruction: "LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.\n\nThe agent must create\
  \ a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.\nThis task does not include local test\
  \ cases. Instead, the test harness:\n  1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit)\
  \ to get a sid,\n  2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == \"done\",\n\
  \  3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.\n\nEnvironment variables\
  \ (overridable at runtime):\n  - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)\n\
  \  - PID: problem id (default 1997A)\n  - LANG: language (default cpp)\n  - CODE_PATH:\
  \ path to code (default /app/main.cpp)\n  - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds\
  \ (default 120)\n\nMonocarp's current password on Codeforces is a string $s$, consisting\
  \ of lowercase Latin letters. Monocarp thinks that his current password is too weak,\
  \ so he wants to insert exactly one lowercase Latin letter into the password to\
  \ make it stronger. Monocarp can choose any letter and insert it anywhere, even\
  \ before the first character or after the last character.\n\nMonocarp thinks that\
  \ the password's strength is proportional to the time it takes him to type the password.\
  \ The time it takes to type the password is calculated as follows:\n\n- the time\
  \ to type the first character is $2$ seconds;\n- for each character other than the\
  \ first, the time it takes to type it is $1$ second if it is the same as the previous\
  \ character, or $2$ seconds otherwise.\n\nFor example, the time it takes to type\
  \ the password abacaba is $14$; the time it takes to type the password a is $2$;\
  \ the time it takes to type the password aaabacc is $11$.\n\nYou have to help Monocarp\
  \ -- insert a lowercase Latin letter into his password so that the resulting password\
  \ takes the maximum possible amount of time to type.\n\n### Input\n\nThe first line\
  \ contains one integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 1000$) -- the number of test cases.\n\
  \nEach test case consists of one line containing the string $s$ ($1 \\le |s| \\\
  le 10$), consisting of lowercase Latin letters.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case,\
  \ print one line containing the new password -- a string which can be obtained from\
  \ $s$ by inserting one lowercase Latin letter. The string you print should have\
  \ the maximum possible required time to type it. If there are multiple answers,\
  \ print any of them.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n4\n\na\n\naaa\n\n\
  abb\n\npassword\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\nwa\naada\nabcb\npastsword\n```"
