instruction: "LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.\n\nThe agent must create\
  \ a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.\nThis task does not include local test\
  \ cases. Instead, the test harness:\n  1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit)\
  \ to get a sid,\n  2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == \"done\",\n\
  \  3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.\n\nEnvironment variables\
  \ (overridable at runtime):\n  - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)\n\
  \  - PID: problem id (default 1995B2)\n  - LANG: language (default cpp)\n  - CODE_PATH:\
  \ path to code (default /app/main.cpp)\n  - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds\
  \ (default 120)\n\nThis is the hard version of the problem. The only difference\
  \ is that in this version, instead of listing the number of petals for each flower,\
  \ the number of petals and the quantity of flowers in the store is set for all types\
  \ of flowers.\n\nA girl is preparing for her birthday and wants to buy the most\
  \ beautiful bouquet. There are a total of $n$ different types of flowers in the\
  \ store, each of which is characterized by the number of petals and the quantity\
  \ of this type of flower. A flower with $k$ petals costs $k$ coins. The girl has\
  \ decided that the difference in the number of petals between any two flowers she\
  \ will use to decorate her cake should not exceed one. At the same time, the girl\
  \ wants to assemble a bouquet with the maximum possible number of petals. Unfortunately,\
  \ she only has $m$ coins, and she cannot spend more. What is the maximum total number\
  \ of petals she can assemble in the bouquet?\n\n### Input\n\nEach test consists\
  \ of several test cases. The first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \\le t\
  \ \\le 10\\,000$) -- the number of test cases. This is followed by descriptions\
  \ of the test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers $n$,\
  \ $m$ ($1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5, 1 \\le m \\le 10^{18}$) -- the number of types\
  \ of flowers in the store and the number of coins the girl possesses, respectively.\
  \ The second line of each test case contains $n$ different integers $a_1, a_2, \\\
  ldots, a_n$ ($1 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$), where $a_i$ is the number of petals of the\
  \ $i$-th flower type in the store (for different indexes $i \\neq j$, it must be\
  \ $a_i \\neq a_j$). The third line of each test case contains $n$ integers $c_1,\
  \ c_2, \\ldots, c_n$ ($1 \\le c_i \\le 10^9$), where $c_i$ is the quantity of the\
  \ $i$-th flower type in the store.\n\nThe sum of $n$ over all test cases does not\
  \ exceed $2 \\cdot {10}^5$.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, print one integer --\
  \ the maximum possible number of petals in a bouquet that a girl can collect, observing\
  \ all the conditions listed above.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n7\n\

  9999999999\n```\n\n### Note\n\nIn the first test case, some valid bouquets are $(1,\
  \ 1, 2, 2), (2, 2, 3), (1, 1), (2, 2)$. The maximum over all valid bouquets not\
  \ greater than $10$ is $7$ for $(2, 2, 3)$. In the second test case, you can assemble\
  \ a valid bouquet with $(206, 206, 207, 207, 207)$ with a sum of $1033$, which is\
  \ the maximum number of petals the girl can buy. In the third test case, you can\
  \ assemble a valid bouquet with $(5, 5, 5, 4)$ with a sum of $19$. It can be seen\
  \ that no valid bouquet can have $20$ petals."
