  \nThis is the easy version of the problem. The only difference is that $x=n$ in\
  \ this version. You must solve both versions to be able to hack.\n\nYou are given\
  \ two integers $n$ and $x$ ($x=n$). There are $n$ balls lined up in a row, numbered\
  \ from $1$ to $n$ from left to right. Initially, there is a value $a_i$ written\
  \ on the $i$-th ball.\n\nFor each integer $i$ from $1$ to $n$, we define a function\
  \ $f(i)$ as follows:\n\n- Suppose you have a set $S = \\{1, 2, \\ldots, i\\}$.\n\
  \n- In each operation, you have to select an integer $l$ ($1 \\leq l < i$) from\
  \ $S$ such that $l$ is not the largest element of $S$. Suppose $r$ is the smallest\
  \ element in $S$ which is greater than $l$.\n\n\n\n- If $a_l > a_r$, you set $a_l\
  \ = a_l + a_r$ and remove $r$ from $S$.\n- If $a_l < a_r$, you set $a_r = a_l +\
  \ a_r$ and remove $l$ from $S$.\n- If $a_l = a_r$, you choose either the integer\
  \ $l$ or $r$ to remove from $S$:\n- If you choose to remove $l$ from $S$, you set\
  \ $a_r = a_l + a_r$ and remove $l$ from $S$.\n- If you choose to remove $r$ from\
  \ $S$, you set $a_l = a_l + a_r$ and remove $r$ from $S$.\n\n- $f(i)$ denotes the\
  \ number of integers $j$ ($1 \\le j \\le i$) such that it is possible to obtain\
  \ $S = \\{j\\}$ after performing the above operations exactly $i - 1$ times.\n\n\
  For each integer $i$ from $x$ to $n$, you need to find $f(i)$.\n\n### Input\n\n\
  The first line contains $t$ ($1 \\leq t \\leq 10^4$) -- the number of test cases.\n\
  \nThe first line of each test case contains two integers $n$ and $x$ ($1 \\leq n\
  \ \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5; x = n$) -- the number of balls and the smallest index $i$\
  \ for which you need to find $f(i)$.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains\
  \ $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$ ($1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$) -- the initial number written\
  \ on each ball.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does\
  \ not exceed $2 \\cdot 10^5$.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, output $n-x+1$\
  \ space separated integers on a new line, where the $j$-th integer should represent\
  \ $f(x+j-1)$.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n3\n\n5 5\n\n1 2 3 2 1\n\n\
  7 7\n\n4 5 1 2 1 4 5\n\n11 11\n\n1 2 3 1 1 9 3 2 4 1 3\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\
  \n```\n3\n4\n4\n```\n\n### Note\n\nIn the first test case, you are required to calculate\
  \ $f(5)$. It can be shown that after $4$ operations, $S$ can contain $2$, $3$, or\
  \ $4$. The following shows the operations required to make $S = \\{4\\}$.\n\n- Initially,\
  \ $S = \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\}$ and $a = [1, 2, 3, 2, 1]$.\n- Choose $l = 1$. Naturally,\
  \ $r = 2$. Since $a_1 < a_2$, we set $a_2 = 1 + 2$ and remove $1$ from $S$. Now,\
  \ $S = \\{2, 3, 4, 5\\}$ and $a = [1, 3, 3, 2, 1]$.\n- Choose $l = 4$. Naturally,\
  \ $r = 5$. Since $a_4 > a_5$, we set $a_4 = 2 + 1$ and remove $5$ from $S$. Now,\
  \ $S = \\{2, 3, 4\\}$ and $a = [1, 3, 3, 3, 1]$.\n- Choose $l = 3$. Naturally, $r\
  \ = 4$. Since $a_3 = a_4$, we have a choice whether to remove $3$ or $4$. Since\
  \ we want to preserve $4$, let's remove $3$. So, set $a_4 = 3 + 3$ and remove $3$\
  \ from $S$. Now, $S = \\{2, 4\\}$ and $a = [1, 3, 3, 6, 1]$.\n- Choose $l = 2$.\
  \ Naturally, $r = 4$. Since $a_2 < a_4$, we set $a_4 = 3 + 6$ and remove $2$ from\
  \ $S$. Finally, $S = \\{4\\}$ and $a = [1, 3, 3, 9, 1]$.\n\nIn the second test case,\
  \ you are required to calculate $f(7)$. It can be shown that after $6$ operations,\
  \ $S$ can contain $2$, $4$, $6$, or $7$."
