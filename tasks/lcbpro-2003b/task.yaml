instruction: "LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.\n\nThe agent must create\
  \ a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.\nThis task does not include local test\
  \ cases. Instead, the test harness:\n  1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit)\
  \ to get a sid,\n  2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == \"done\",\n\
  \  3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.\n\nEnvironment variables\
  \ (overridable at runtime):\n  - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)\n\
  \  - PID: problem id (default 2003B)\n  - LANG: language (default cpp)\n  - CODE_PATH:\
  \ path to code (default /app/main.cpp)\n  - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds\
  \ (default 120)\n\nTurtle and Piggy are playing a game on a sequence. They are given\
  \ a sequence $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$, and Turtle goes first. Turtle and Piggy alternate\
  \ in turns (so, Turtle does the first turn, Piggy does the second, Turtle does the\
  \ third, etc.).\n\nThe game goes as follows:\n\n- Let the current length of the\
  \ sequence be $m$. If $m = 1$, the game ends.\n- If the game does not end and it's\
  \ Turtle's turn, then Turtle must choose an integer $i$ such that $1 \\le i \\le\
  \ m - 1$, set $a_i$ to $\\max(a_i, a_{i + 1})$, and remove $a_{i + 1}$.\n- If the\
  \ game does not end and it's Piggy's turn, then Piggy must choose an integer $i$\
  \ such that $1 \\le i \\le m - 1$, set $a_i$ to $\\min(a_i, a_{i + 1})$, and remove\
  \ $a_{i + 1}$.\n\nTurtle wants to maximize the value of $a_1$ in the end, while\
  \ Piggy wants to minimize the value of $a_1$ in the end. Find the value of $a_1$\
  \ in the end if both players play optimally.\n\nYou can refer to notes for further\
  \ clarification.\n\n### Input\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first\
  \ line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 10^4$). The description\
  \ of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single\
  \ integer $n$ ($2 \\le n \\le 10^5$) -- the length of the sequence.\n\nThe second\
  \ line of each test case contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$ ($1 \\le\
  \ a_i \\le 10^5$) -- the elements of the sequence $a$.\n\nIt is guaranteed that\
  \ the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $10^5$.\n\n### Output\n\nFor\
  \ each test case, output a single integer -- the value of $a_1$ in the end if both\
  \ players play optimally.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n5\n\n2\n\n1\
  \ 2\n\n3\n\n1 1 2\n\n3\n\n1 2 3\n\n5\n\n3 1 2 2 3\n\n10\n\n10 2 5 2 7 9 2 5 10 7\n\
  \n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n2\n1\n2\n2\n7\n```\n\n### Note\n\nIn the first test\
  \ case, initially $a = [1, 2]$. Turtle can only choose $i = 1$. Then he will set\
  \ $a_1$ to $\\max(a_1, a_2) = 2$ and remove $a_2$. The sequence $a$ becomes $[2]$.\
  \ Then the length of the sequence becomes $1$, and the game will end. The value\
  \ of $a_1$ is $2$, so you should output $2$.\n\nIn the second test case, one of\
  \ the possible game processes is as follows:\n\n- Initially $a = [1, 1, 2]$.\n-\
  \ Turtle can choose $i = 2$. Then he will set $a_2$ to $\\max(a_2, a_3) = 2$ and\
  \ remove $a_3$. The sequence $a$ will become $[1, 2]$.\n- Piggy can choose $i =\
  \ 1$. Then he will set $a_1$ to $\\min(a_1, a_2) = 1$ and remove $a_2$. The sequence\
  \ $a$ will become $[1]$.\n- The length of the sequence becomes $1$, so the game\
  \ will end. The value of $a_1$ will be $1$ in the end.\n\nIn the fourth test case,\
  \ one of the possible game processes is as follows:\n\n- Initially $a = [3, 1, 2,\
  \ 2, 3]$.\n- Turtle can choose $i = 4$. Then he will set $a_4$ to $\\max(a_4, a_5)\
  \ = 3$ and remove $a_5$. The sequence $a$ will become $[3, 1, 2, 3]$.\n- Piggy can\
  \ choose $i = 3$. Then he will set $a_3$ to $\\min(a_3, a_4) = 2$ and remove $a_4$.\
  \ The sequence $a$ will become $[3, 1, 2]$.\n- Turtle can choose $i = 2$. Then he\
  \ will set $a_2$ to $\\max(a_2, a_3) = 2$ and remove $a_3$. The sequence $a$ will\
  \ become $[3, 2]$.\n- Piggy can choose $i = 1$. Then he will set $a_1$ to $\\min(a_1,\
  \ a_2) = 2$ and remove $a_2$. The sequence $a$ will become $[2]$.\n- The length\
  \ of the sequence becomes $1$, so the game will end. The value of $a_1$ will be\
  \ $2$ in the end."
