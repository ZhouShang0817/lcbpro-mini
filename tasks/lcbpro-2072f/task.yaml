instruction: "LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.\n\nThe agent must create\
  \ a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.\nThis task does not include local test\
  \ cases. Instead, the test harness:\n  1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit)\
  \ to get a sid,\n  2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == \"done\",\n\
  \  3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.\n\nEnvironment variables\
  \ (overridable at runtime):\n  - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)\n\
  \  - PID: problem id (default 2072F)\n  - LANG: language (default cpp)\n  - CODE_PATH:\
  \ path to code (default /app/main.cpp)\n  - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds\
  \ (default 120)\n\nMonsters are approaching the city, and to protect it, Akito must\
  \ create a protective field around the city. As everyone knows, protective fields\
  \ come in various levels. Akito has chosen the field of level $n$. To construct\
  \ the field, a special phrase is required, which is the $n$-th row of the Great\
  \ Magical Triangle, represented as a two-dimensional array. We will call this array\
  \ $T$.\n\nThe triangle is defined as follows:\n\n- In the $i$-th row, there are\
  \ $i$ integers.\n- The single integer in the first row is $k$.\n- Let the $j$-th\
  \ element of the $i$-th row be denoted as $T\\_{i,j}$. Then\n\n$$T_{i,j} = \\begin{cases}\
  \ T_{i-1,j-1} \\oplus T_{i-1,j}, &\\textrm{if } 1 < j < i \\\\ T_{i-1,j}, &\\textrm{if\
  \ } j = 1 \\\\ T_{i-1,j-1}, &\\textrm{if } j = i \\end{cases}$$\n\nwhere $a \\oplus\
  \ b$ is the bitwise [exclusive \"OR\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR)(XOR)\
  \ of the integers $a$ and $b$.\n\nHelp Akito find the integers in the $n$-th row\
  \ of the infinite triangle before the monsters reach the city.\n\n### Input\n\n\
  The first line contains the integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 10^4$) -- the number of\
  \ test cases.\n\nIn the only line of each test case, there are two integers $n$\
  \ and $k$ ($1 \\le n \\le 10^6,\\ 1 \\le k < 2^{31}$) -- the row index that Akito\
  \ needs and the integer in the first row of the Great Magical Triangle, respectively.\n\
  \nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ across all test cases does not exceed $10^6$.\n\
  \n### Output\n\nFor each test case, output $n$ integers -- the elements of the $n$-th\
  \ row of the Great Magical Triangle.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n\
  5\n\n1 5\n\n2 10\n\n3 16\n\n9 1\n\n1 52\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n5\n10 10\n\
  16 0 16\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1\n52\n```\n\n### Note\n\nIn the first example, the first\
  \ row of the Great Magical Triangle is $[5]$ by definition.\n\nIn the second example,\
  \ $T_{2,1} = T_{1,1} = 10$ and $T_{2,2} = T_{1, 1} = 10$."
